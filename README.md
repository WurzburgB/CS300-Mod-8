# CS300-Mod-8 In this project, we addressed the challenge of efficiently sorting through data in an Excel sheet. First, I analyzed the problem statement and requirements to determine the most appropriate data structure based on the specific characteristics of the problem. Understanding data structures is crucial for effective problem-solving, as it enables efficient manipulation of data. When encountering roadblocks, I utilized various resources, including my professor, SNHUâ€™s tutor system, and YouTube. This project has provided me with a deeper understanding of how to prepare effectively for project development and select the appropriate structure for different scenarios.
